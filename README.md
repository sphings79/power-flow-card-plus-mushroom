> [!NOTE]
> **This is a fork.** It builds on [flixlix/power-flow-card-plus](https://github.com/flixlix/power-flow-card-plus) by [@flixlix](https://github.com/flixlix), who wrote the original card and deserves the credit for it. This fork adds multiple batteries, multiple PV sources, unlimited individual devices and a Mushroom-style appearance.

## Fork additions: Multiple Batteries, Multiple PV & unlimited Individual devices

> [!WARNING]
> **Breaking change — the card type was renamed.** Earlier builds of this fork used
> `custom:power-flow-card-plus-multi`. It is now `custom:power-flow-card-plus-mushroom`.
>
> If you used an earlier build, edit every affected card and change its `type:` accordingly —
> otherwise Home Assistant will show *"Custom element doesn't exist"*. Nothing else about your
> configuration needs to change.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **This fork uses its own card type so it can run side by side with the original card.**
> - Card type in YAML: **`custom:power-flow-card-plus-mushroom`**
> - JavaScript resource file: **`power-flow-card-plus-mushroom.js`**
> - Name in the card picker: **“Power Flow Card Plus (Mushroom)”**
>
> Every custom element in this bundle is uniquely named, so installing both the original `power-flow-card-plus` and this fork at the same time does not clash. Add the fork as a separate dashboard resource pointing to `power-flow-card-plus-mushroom.js`.

> [!NOTE]
> The `sources`, `batteries` and `max_individual_in_grid` options are **additions of this fork** (`sphings79/power-flow-card-plus-mushroom`) and are not part of the upstream card. Everything else works exactly like upstream; an upstream configuration keeps working once you switch its `type:` to `custom:power-flow-card-plus-mushroom`.

This fork lets you drive the main **Solar** and **Battery** nodes from *several* entities and lift the four-device limit on **Individual** entities. The main nodes keep the familiar aggregated look and animated flows; each underlying device is additionally listed in a compact, docked breakdown directly below the flow diagram.

### Multiple PV sources (`solar.sources`)

Provide a list of PV sources instead of (or in addition to) a single `solar.entity`. Their power is **summed** into the main solar node, and each source is listed below the diagram. If you omit `solar.entity`, the aggregate is computed automatically from the sources.

```yaml
type: custom:power-flow-card-plus-mushroom
entities:
  solar:
    # entity: sensor.pv_total   # optional – omit to auto-sum the sources
    sources:
      - entity: sensor.pv_roof_south
        name: Roof South
      - entity: sensor.pv_roof_east
        name: Roof East
      - entity: sensor.pv_garage
        name: Garage
```

Each source accepts: `entity` (required), `name`, `icon`, `color`, `invert_state`.

### Multiple batteries (`battery.batteries`)

Provide a list of batteries. Their power is **summed** into the main battery node. If you don't set an aggregate `battery.state_of_charge`, the node's state of charge is the **average** of the individual batteries' states of charge (summing percentages would be wrong). Each battery is listed below the diagram with its own power and state of charge.

```yaml
type: custom:power-flow-card-plus-mushroom
entities:
  battery:
    # entity: sensor.battery_total_power        # optional – omit to auto-sum
    # state_of_charge: sensor.battery_total_soc # optional – omit to average
    color_circle: color_dynamically
    batteries:
      - entity: sensor.battery_1_power
        state_of_charge: sensor.battery_1_soc
        name: Battery 1
      - entity: sensor.battery_2_power
        state_of_charge: sensor.battery_2_soc
        name: Battery 2
```

Each battery accepts: `entity` (required), `state_of_charge`, `name`, `icon`, `color`, `state_of_charge_unit`, `state_of_charge_decimals`, `invert_state`.

### More than 4 Individual devices

The `individual` list is unlimited. The first four devices occupy the four corner slots of the flow diagram (as before); any **additional** devices are rendered in the docked list below the diagram. Use `max_individual_in_grid` (0–4, default 4) to control how many go into the corners — set it to `0` to move *all* individual devices into the list.

```yaml
type: custom:power-flow-card-plus-mushroom
max_individual_in_grid: 4   # optional, 0..4 (default 4)
entities:
  individual:
    - { entity: sensor.car, name: Car }
    - { entity: sensor.washer, name: Washing Machine }
    - { entity: sensor.dishwasher, name: Dishwasher }
    - { entity: sensor.oven, name: Oven }
    - { entity: sensor.server, name: Server }     # 5th+ -> shown in the list
    - { entity: sensor.pool, name: Pool Pump }
```

> [!TIP]
> All sub-entities of one node should share the same unit (e.g. all `W` or all `kW`); the aggregate uses the first entity's unit. The docked list items are clickable (more-info) when `clickable_entities` is enabled.

### Mushroom appearance

Set `appearance: mushroom` to restyle the card so it sits comfortably next to
[Mushroom](https://github.com/piitaya/lovelace-mushroom) cards. This is a pure
styling switch — no entity, layout or behaviour change — so you can flip between
the two looks at any time.

```yaml
type: custom:power-flow-card-plus-mushroom
appearance: mushroom   # classic (default) | mushroom
entities:
  grid:
    entity: sensor.grid_power
```

What changes compared to `classic`:

- **Shapes instead of rings** — the circles lose their 2px outline and are filled
  with their own colour at 20% opacity, with the icon in full colour. This is the
  same shape treatment Mushroom uses for its icons.
- **Typography** — values and labels adopt Mushroom's weights and sizes;
  secondary info is dimmed rather than drawn in full contrast.
- **Softer flow lines** — slightly thicker with rounded caps, so they read as
  strokes rather than hairlines.
- **Breakdown list as chips** — the docked list of PV sources / batteries / extra
  individual devices becomes a row of tinted chips with their own icon shapes,
  instead of the left-border list style.

#### Fine-tuning

Three CSS custom properties are available, settable per card via
`style_card_content` or globally in your theme:

| Property                | Default                               | Description                                                      |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `--pfcp-shape-strength` | `20%`                                 | Opacity of the shape fill. Lower is subtler, higher is bolder.    |
| `--pfcp-shape-radius`   | `var(--mush-icon-border-radius, 50%)` | Shape corner radius. Follows your Mushroom theme if it sets one.  |
| `--pfcp-shape-fallback` | `var(--primary-color)`                | Fill colour used when a node has no colour of its own.            |

For squared shapes, matching a Mushroom theme with squared icons:

```yaml
appearance: mushroom
style_card_content: "--pfcp-shape-radius: 12px;"
```

> [!NOTE]
> The shape fill uses the CSS `color-mix()` function. Every browser Home
> Assistant currently supports handles it; on an older browser the shapes simply
> render transparent rather than breaking the layout.


## Goal

The Goal of this card is to provide an easy to understand and visualize way of displaying the current Power Distribution coming from and to different sources, such as solar, grid, home batteries etc. Furthermore, this card aims to expose a lot of customizability and control of its behavior to the configuration, allowing users to tailor it to their specific requirements.

## Scope

This card **does not** aim to display Energy Values (Meaning accumulated power over 1 day, for example).
If this is your goal, check out the [Energy Flow Card Plus](https://github.com/flixlix/energy-flow-card-plus).

## Guides

In case you want to watch a tutorial instead of reading through this very long readme 😅, I recommend the following videos.

> [!NOTE]
> These videos cover the **original** card. They are still a good introduction to the shared options, but they do not show this fork's additions (multiple batteries, multiple PV sources, unlimited individual devices, Mushroom appearance).

- [Power Flow Card Plus in Home Assistant - Jetzt noch besser? Anleitung from Smartzeug](https://youtu.be/PUOU5qdhMro) - _in german_, up to date with version 0.2.2
- [Power Flow Card Plus for Home Assistant from Speak to the Geek](https://youtu.be/C4Zh35E9wJE?si=REuWZxmfF91G0Ht7) - _changes in indvidual configuration_

## Installation

### HACS (custom repository)

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=sphings79&repository=power-flow-card-plus-mushroom&category=Dashboard)

This fork is **not** in the HACS default store, so searching for it will not find it. Add it as a custom repository first. To install HACS itself, follow these [instructions](https://hacs.xyz/docs/setup/prerequisites).

1. In Home Assistant, open **HACS**.
2. Open the three-dot menu (top right) and choose **Custom repositories**.
3. Repository: `https://github.com/sphings79/power-flow-card-plus-mushroom` — Category: **Dashboard**.
4. Add it, then search for **Power Flow Card Plus Mushroom** in HACS and download it.

The button above does steps 1–3 for you.

<details>
<summary>Manual install</summary>

1. Download and copy `power-flow-card-plus-mushroom.js` from the [latest release](https://github.com/sphings79/power-flow-card-plus-mushroom/releases/latest) into your `config/www` directory.

2. Add the resource reference as decribed below.

### Add resource reference

If you configure Dashboards via YAML, add a reference to `power-flow-card-plus-mushroom.js` inside your `configuration.yaml`:

```yaml
resources:
  - url: /local/power-flow-card-plus-mushroom.js
    type: module
```

Else, if you prefer the graphical editor, use the menu to add the resource:

1. Make sure, advanced mode is enabled in your user profile (click on your user name to get there)
2. Navigate to Settings -> Dashboards
3. Click three dot icon
4. Select Resources
5. Hit (+ ADD RESOURCE) icon
6. Enter URL `/local/power-flow-card-plus-mushroom.js` and select type "JavaScript Module".
   (Use `/hacsfiles/power-flow-card-plus-mushroom/power-flow-card-plus-mushroom.js` and select "JavaScript Module" for HACS install if HACS didn't do it already)

</details>

## Usage

> [!WARNING]  
> This card offers a **LOT** of configuration options. Don't worry, if you want your card's appearance to match the oficial Energy Flow Card, you will only need to setup the entities. The rest of the options only enable further customization. If this is your goal, please go to [Minimal Configuration](#minimal-configuration)

#### Action Configuration

The card supports Home Assistant action configs on entity circles and other clickable entity surfaces.

| Name              | Type     | Description                           |
| ----------------- | -------- | ------------------------------------- |
| tap_action        | `object` | Action triggered on tap/click.        |
| hold_action       | `object` | Action triggered on long press.       |
| double_tap_action | `object` | Action triggered on double tap/click. |

If none of these actions are configured for a clickable entity surface, the card falls back to opening more-info when `clickable_entities: true`.

#### Entities object

At least one of _grid_, _battery_, or _solar_ is required. All entites (except _battery_charge_) should have a `unit_of_measurement` attribute of W(watts) or kW(kilowatts).

Otherwise, white space will be added.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| calculate_flow_rate | `boolean` or `number` | `false`         | If set to `true`, the flow rate will be calculated by using the flow rate formula (either the new or the old one, depending on your configuration). If set to a number, the flow rate will be set to that number. For example, defining the value `10` will ensure one dot will flow every 10 seconds.                                                                                                                                                         |

| entity              | `string` required     | Entity ID providing a state that changes when there is a Power Outage. (eg: `binary_sensor.grid_connection_status`). Doesn't need to be a binary_sensor.                                                                                                                                               |
| entity_generator    | `string`              | Entity ID providing the power of a Generator. (eg: `sensor.generator_power`). This is optional, meaning if you don't use this, the card will assume the grid is the only source of power.                                                                                                              |
| state_alert         | `string`              | The state the provided entity is at when there is a power outage. Default is `on`, meaning if the entity's state is `on` the card will assume there is a power outage.                                                                                                                                 |
| icon_alert          | `string`              | An icon path to be override the grid icon when there is a power outage. Default is `mdi:transmission-tower-off`.                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| label_alert         | `string`              | A text that will be displayed below the icon when there is a power outage.                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |

|                     |                       | If set to `true`, the flow rate will be calculated by using the flow rate formula (either the new or the old one, depending on your configuration). If set to a number, the flow rate will be set to that number. For example, defining the value `10` will ensure one dot will flow every 10 seconds. |

#### Display Zero Lines

This object allows you to control the behavior of the flow lines that are inactive.

| mode         | string                        | Valid Options are: `show`, `hide`, `transparency`, `grey_out`, `custom`                                                                                                                     |
| transparency | number                        | A number between 0 and 100. 100 means the line doesn't show at all. 0 means the line shows in full opacity. Default is 50. Will be used when the mode is either `transparency` or `custom`. |
| grey_color   | `string` or `list of numbers` | Either a HEX Code or a List of three numbers between 0 and 255 in RGB order. Will be used when the mode is either `grey_out` or `custom`.                                                   |

### Minimal Configuration

> Don't forget to change the entity ids

The following configurations will allow you to achieve your results with the least amount of lines of code / complexity.
In these examples I decided to use the Split entities option, but feel free to use the combined entity option. [More Info](#split-entities)

#### Only Grid

```yaml
type: custom:power-flow-card-plus-mushroom
entities:
  grid:
    entity: sensor.grid_power
    power_outage:
      entity: sensor.power_outage
    display_state: one_way
    color_circle: true
watt_threshold: 10000
```

This should give you something like this:

### UI Editor (available in version 0.2)

> [!TIP]
> I've made a lot of improvements in version 0.2 for the UI-Editor. Now each field has its own subpage, meaning there is now much less scrolling.
> The biggest change in the editor is the fact that you can now add up to 4 individual devices, all through the UI! 🥳

### Flow Formula

This formula is based on the official formula used by the Energy Distribution card.

```js
max - (value / totalLines) * (max - min);
// max = max_flow_rate
// min = min_flow_rate
// value = line value, solar to grid for example
// totalLines = gridConsumption + solarConsumption + solarToBattery +
//   solarToGrid + batteryConsumption + batteryFromGrid + batteryToGrid
```

### New Flow Formula

In contrast to the old flow formula, this formula calculates the flow rate independently from other lines, making it more intuitive to interpret the perceived power. This means that a state of `10W` will always flow with the same velocity, no matter what other lines are doing. In other words this flow rate is calculated in absolute and not relative values.

To get this new Flow Formula to work, simply set `use_new_flow_rate_model` in the main configuration to true. You may want to play around with the `max_expected_power`, `min_expected_power`, `max_flow_rate` and `min_flow_rate` to get the speeds that you wish

```js
if (value > maxIn) return maxOut; // In case power exceeds maximum expected power, use the fastest speed and ignore the rest.
return ((value - minIn) * (maxOut - minOut)) / (maxIn - minIn) + minOut;

// value = value of the current line to calculate (eg: grid to home)
//
// minIn = amount of watts at which the lowest speed will be selected.
//   ↳ In your configuration this is `min_expected_power`
//   ↳ eg: setting this at `100` means that at `100` watts, the dots will still flow at the lowest speed
// maxIn = amount of watts at which the highest speed will be selected.
//   ↳ In your configuration this is `max_expected_power`
//   ↳ eg: setting this at `2000` means that everything more than `2000` will flow at the highest speed selected
//
// minOut = amount of watts at which the lowest speed will be selected.
//   ↳ In your configuration this is `max_flow_rate`
//   ↳ eg: setting this at `5` means that one dot will take `5` second to travel
// maxOut = amount of watts at which the highest speed will be selected.
//   ↳ In your configuration this is `min_flow_rate`
//   ↳ eg: setting this at `1` means that one dot will take `1` second to travel
```

The following video aims to show the diffence between the two flow formulas:

Notice that when the Power changes to only coming from the sun, the old formula accelerates to maintain a constant amount of dots/second.
Using the new formula is more intuitive, since you can immediately see that the Solar Power is relatively low since the dots are flowing very slowly.
On the old Flow Formula you might think that the sun is producing a lot of power, which in this case is not true.

At the end of the day these are two options and depending on what you're interested, one might suit you better than the other, that's why I kept the old formula, you have the choice. 🙂

### To-Do List

Here is my to-do list containing a few enhancements I am planning in adding. The ones at the top are bigger priorities, so they’ll probably be available before the ones at the bottom.

- [x] Change Tap Action Behavior to be compatible with Browser Mod
- Fill the circles [#89](https://github.com/flixlix/power-flow-card-plus/issues/89)
- [x] More than two Individual Devices [#54](https://github.com/flixlix/power-flow-card-plus/issues/54)
- More than one solar source [#23](https://github.com/flixlix/power-flow-card-plus/issues/23)
- Display Connected/Disconnected status [#111](https://github.com/flixlix/power-flow-card-plus/issues/111)
- Grid Feed In Circle [#119](https://github.com/flixlix/power-flow-card-plus/issues/119)
- Improve performance [#144](https://github.com/flixlix/power-flow-card-plus/issues/144)

I am still just one person working on this project and obviously have other things going on in my life, so feel free to contribute to the project. You can also feel free to create a PR with a new feature and I'll try my best to review it 😊
